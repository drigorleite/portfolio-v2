        <h1>My Learning Journal</h1>
        <p class="blog-intro">
          Hereâ€™s where I reflect on what Iâ€™m learning â€” the wins, the mistakes, and everything in between.

            <button class="blog-toggle">Why I Designed TimeCash the Way I Did <span class="date">Â· April 2024</span></button>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p>TimeCash was the first project I built that solved a real problem in my life. No tutorials, no copying code â€” just me, a goal, and a lot of trial and error.</p>
              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p>I was managing payments for workers on a weekly basis, and it was getting messy. I needed something simple, visual, and central â€” something that I could access easily and update quickly.</p>
              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>I decided to build TimeCash: a personal payment tracker where I could see who worked when, how much they earned, and what was still unpaid. It had to be clean. No bloat. Just week, names, values, and totals.</p>
              <h3>What I Learned</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>How to actually structure something from scratch</li>
                <li>How design decisions are tied to real use, not just aesthetics</li>
                <li>That coding is much more fun when youâ€™re solving your own problem</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>What Iâ€™ll Improve</h3>
              <p>
                - Add authentication<br>
                - Turn it into a CRUD app<br>
                - Possibly make it public

            <button class="blog-toggle">How I Integrated My First API (And Almost Gave Up ðŸ˜…) <span class="date">Â· May 2024</span></button>
            <div class="blog-content">
              <p>Integrating an API for the first time was like trying to solve a Rubikâ€™s cube blindfolded. But I learned more in that week than I had in a month of tutorials.</p>
              <h3>What I Was Trying To Do</h3>
              <p>I wanted to pull weather data for my site using a public API. Sounds easy, right? Until I hit async issues, CORS errors, and a lot of confusion.</p>
              <h3>What Went Wrong</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Didnâ€™t understand how fetch() worked</li>
                <li>Confused .then() vs async/await</li>
                <li>Didnâ€™t know what to do with JSON</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>How I Solved It</h3>
              <p>I opened DevTools, read the API docs carefully, logged everything, and finally got it working. The first time I saw "temperature: 13Â°C" show up, I cheered out loud.</p>
              <h3>What I Learned</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>APIs are powerful when you understand them</li>
                <li>console.log is your best friend</li>
                <li>Itâ€™s okay to slow down and figure things out</li>
              </ul>
