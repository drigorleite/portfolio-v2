                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm Rodrigo Leite, a Brazilian developer currently living in Michigan.
                    My journey into tech wasn’t linear — and that’s what makes it real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up surrounded by law — my father and siblings are all lawyers. So, naturally, I followed that
                    path too.
                    But deep down, I was always drawn to tech. I admired people like Steve Jobs not just for the
                    products,
                    but for how they thought. I loved the idea of creating something that could impact others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I eventually decided to give tech a real shot. At first, I studied IT Management in Brazil while
                    keeping law as a backup.
                    But soon, it was clear — coding was where I belonged. I loved the logic, the freedom, and the
                    challenge.
                    Today, I’m pursuing a degree in Applications Development in the U.S. and building real projects that
                    solve real problems.

                            Studied Law. Managed teams. Organized large events and tournaments.
                            Built leadership skills that now fuel my developer mindset.

                        <p>
                            I love building things from scratch, making systems clear and useful, and learning fast.
                            I don’t fear pressure — I seek it. It makes me grow. My goal is to join a team that
                            challenges me every day.
                        </p>
